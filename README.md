# Global_AI_Challenge

A set of labeled datasets on the experimental activity of small molecules on COVID-19
You have to build structure-activity relationship for COVID-19 targets. Classification metrics will be used for the leaderboard

To submit you solution you have to upload submission.csv file with binary labeled molecules  as model outputs

F1 metric will be used for evaluation

Pdb structure of protein, train csv file and unlabelled test file can be found on zip file
